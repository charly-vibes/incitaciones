# Claude Code - Start Here

## Essential Reading

**📖 Repository structure and workflow:**
→ [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)

**🔄 Commit workflow (CRITICAL):**
→ [content/prompt-workflow-deliberate-commits.md](content/prompt-workflow-deliberate-commits.md)

## Key Principle

**Never commit without following the deliberate commit workflow.**

When asked to commit:
1. Read the commit workflow prompt (link above)
2. Follow its process exactly
3. Wait for user approval before proceeding

All other information is in AGENTS.md - read that first.
